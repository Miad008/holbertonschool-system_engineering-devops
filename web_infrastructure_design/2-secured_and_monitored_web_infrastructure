## Components
- **Firewalls (3)**: Protect each server by filtering traffic.  
- **SSL Certificate**: Encrypts traffic over HTTPS for `www.foobar.com`.  
- **Monitoring Clients (3)**: Collect logs/metrics and send to monitoring service.  
- **Load Balancer (HAProxy)**: Distributes requests between 2 servers.  
- **Servers**: Each with Nginx, app server, codebase, and MySQL.  

## Why Add These
- **Firewalls**: Block unauthorized access.  
- **HTTPS (SSL)**: Ensures data privacy and security.  
- **Monitoring**: Tracks uptime, errors, and QPS (queries per second).  

## Issues
- **SSL Termination at LB**: Traffic between LB and servers not encrypted.  
- **Single DB Write Node**: One master â†’ risk of failure.  
- **Identical Servers**: Mixing DB, app, and web on same machine can cause performance and security issues.
